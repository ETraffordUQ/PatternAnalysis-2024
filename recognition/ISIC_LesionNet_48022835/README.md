## Project Overview
### YOLO Architecture Description and Purpose
The *You-Only-Look-Once* (YOLO) architecture is a real-time object detection algorithm that is known for maximising speed while maintaining accuracy. Unlike traditional object detection methods, YOLO treats object detection as a single regression problem. That is to say, it predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from an entire image in one forward pass through the convolutional neural network.  
Since their emergence in 2015, YOLO models have made massive performance progressions in terms of reliability, accuracy and speed. This has led to their inevitable integration into many modern systems around the world. The problems that YOLO models can solve are wide-ranging, such as real-time object detection for surveillance and autonomous driving.  
The capability of a YOLO model to predict the precise location of multiple objects and classify them across varying environments in ways that few other models can ensures that YOLO models will always serve a purpose and be suited to solve specific problems.
